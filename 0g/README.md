# About 0G System
  * **Infinite Scalability:** 0G provides an infinitely scalable data availability layer with a built-in storage layer, capable of handling large volumes of Web2 and Web3 data, including on-chain AI.
  * **Data Storage Lane:** Achieves horizontal scalability through efficient data partitioning, allowing for large data transfers to be nearly instantaneous.
  * **Data Publishing Lane:** Guarantees data availability using a quorum-based system with VRF for random quorum selection, ensuring no data broadcasting bottlenecks.
  * **0G Storage:** On-chain database with Storage Nodes participating in Proof of Random Access (PoRA), rewarding nodes for correctly answering queries about archived data.
  * **0G DA Layer:** Built on top of 0G Storage, this layer uses a quorum-based architecture and VRF to ensure data availability, with GPUs accelerating the erasure coding process.
  * **Layer 2 (L2) Scalability:** Provides a 1,000x performance improvement over Ethereumâ€™s danksharding and a 4x improvement over Solanaâ€™s Firedancer, supporting Web3â€™s massive data scaling needs.
  * **AI Integration:** Stores vast datasets and facilitates quick, on-chain AI model operations using 0G DA.

## Tools

- **0G storage status checker** / **Available on [Discord](https://discord.gg/BCeXe63Mm8)**: 0G storage status checker, the ultimate tool for ensuring the reliability and security of your 0G storage node. Designed with the community in mind, this checker allows you to easily verify the status of your storage node. Simply enter your IP and port to get started.
- **0G community [Discord](https://discord.gg/BCeXe63Mm8) faucet**: The 0G DTEAM Community Faucet is designed as a reliable backup solution to ensure that users can always receive tokens, even if the main faucet experiences problems. You can receive up to 1 token every 24 hours.
