# About Celestia
  * **Modular Architecture:** Celestia separates the consensus and data availability layers from the execution layer, allowing for customizable execution environments.
    
  * **Scalability:** Decoupling data availability from transaction execution results in higher throughput and greater transaction capacity.
    
  * **Data Availability Sampling:** This technique ensures all data in a block is available without requiring nodes to download the entire block, improving security and reducing bandwidth needs.
    
  * **Sovereign Rollups:** Supports independent execution environments that leverage Celestia's consensus and data availability.
    
  * **Interoperability:** Facilitates seamless integration and communication across different blockchain networks.
    
  * **Decentralization:** Lowers the barrier to running a full node, promoting a more decentralized and secure network.
    
  * **Ease of Use:** Simplifies development with clear APIs and tools, allowing developers to focus on application logic.

  * **Security:** Employs advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure data integrity and protection.
    
  * **Economics:** Introduces a novel economic model that incentivizes validators and supports network sustainability.
